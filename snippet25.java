ï‚· Error to Investigate: Why does this code not compile? What does the error tell you about the 
types allowed in switch expressions? How can you modify the code to make it work? 

//This code does not compile because the switch statement does not support double as a valid type for the switch expression. The error message will indicate an incompatible types issue.
As we can modify the code by changing double to int 

//Corrected Code:

public class Switch { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
       int score = 85; 
        switch(score) { 
            case 100: 
                System.out.println("Perfect score!"); 
                break; 
            case 85: 
                System.out.println("Great job!"); 
                break; 
            default: 
                System.out.println("Keep trying!"); 
        } 
    } 
} 
//it will give output as Great job!
