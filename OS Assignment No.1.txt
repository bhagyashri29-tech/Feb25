        ASSIGNMENT NO.1 (OS)

Problem 1: Read the instructions carefully and answer accordingly. If there is 
any need to insert some data then do that as well.  
 
a) Navigate and List: 
a. Start by navigating to your home directory and list its contents. Then, move into a 
directory named "LinuxAssignment" if it exists; otherwise, create it. 

ANS: Command I used for Navigate and List:
pwd                          //Present walking directory
cd                          // Home directory
ls                          //List its contents
mkdir  LinuxAssignment    //Creating "LinuxAssignment" if it doesn’t exist
cd LinuxAssignment          // Moving into "LinuxAssignment"

//Performance on Ubuntu

 cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~$ pwd
/home/cdac
cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~$ cd
cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~$ ls
-  Feb25  LinuxAssignment
cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~$ cd LinuxAssignment
cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~/LinuxAssignment$


b) File Management: 
a. Inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory, create a new file named "file1.txt". Display its 
contents.
 
ANS: For File Management Command I used: 

touch file1.txt      // Creating "file1.txt"
cat file1.txt        // Display its contents (It will be empty initially)

//Performing this command on Ubuntu
cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~/LinuxAssignment$ touch file1.txt
cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~/LinuxAssignment$ cat file1.txt
cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~/LinuxAssignment$
 there is nothing in the file hence it shows empty
 
c) Directory Management: 
a. Create a new directory named "docs" inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory. 

ANS: For Directory Management:
mkdir docs           // Creating "docs" directory inside "LinuxAssignment"

//performing thos on Ubuntu:
cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~/LinuxAssignment$ mkdir docs
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘docs’: File exists
cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~/LinuxAssignment$ cd docs
cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ 
//actually i already created the docs directory thats why it gives file exist

d) Copy and Move Files: 
a. Copy the "file1.txt" file into the "docs" directory and rename it to "file2.txt".
 
ANS: For Copy and Move Files:
cp file1.txt file2.txt       // Copy "file1.txt" to and rename it to "file2.txt"
as our current path: ~/LinuxAssignment/docs so need of giving docs/ command between file1.txt and file2.txt

cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ cp file1.txt file2.txt
cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$

e) Permissions and Ownership: 
a. Change the permissions of "file2.txt" to allow read, write, and execute permissions for 
the owner and only read permissions for others. Then, change the owner of "file2.txt" to 
the current user.

Ans: For Permission and Ownership:
chmod 744 file2.txt        // Set permissions: rwx for owner, r-- for others
chown $USER file2.txt      // Change ownership to current user

file permissions is represented in 3 groups.
Owner (User)
Group
Others (World)

each digit is a sum of Owner Group and Others
4 (r) → Read
2 (w) → Write
1 (x) → Execute
for Owner read + write + Execute
  that is 4+2+1= 7
Group read + write + Execute
  that is 4+0+0= 4
Others read + write + Execute
  that is 4+0+0= 4


cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ chmod 744 file2.txt
cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ chown user file2.txt
cdac@DESKTOP-7KRRNI4:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$
 
f) Final Checklist: 
a. Finally, list the contents of the "LinuxAssignment" directory and the root directory to 
ensure that all operations were performed correctly. 
Ans:
ls -l LinuxAssignment        // List contents of "LinuxAssignment"
ls -l /                      //List contents of root directory

g) File Searching: 
a. Search for all files with the extension ".txt" in the current directory and its subdirectories. 
b. Display lines containing a specific word in a file (provide a file name and the specific 
word to search).
Ans:  
find all.txt           //Search for all .txt files in current directory & subdirectories
grep "specific_word" file1.txt  //Search for a specific word inside "file1.txt"


h) System Information: 
a. Display the current system date and time.
Ans: date                        //Display current system date and time
 
i) Networking: 
a. Display the IP address of the system. 
b. Ping a remote server to check connectivity (provide a remote server address to ping).
Ans: 
ip a | grep "inet "          //Display system IP address
ping -c 4 google.com         //Ping a remote server to check connectivity
 
j) File Compression: 
a. Compress the "docs" directory into a zip file. 
b. Extract the contents of the zip file into a new directory. 
Ans:
zip -r docs.zip docs             // Compress "docs" directory into a zip file
mkdir extracted_docs             //Create a directory to extract files
unzip docs.zip -d extracted_docs // Extract zip contents into "extracted_docs"

k) File Editing: 
a. Open the "file1.txt" file in a text editor and add some text to it. 
b. Replace a specific word in the "file1.txt" file with another word (provide the original 
word and the word to replace it with).
Ans:
nano file1.txt                           // Open "file1.txt" in a text editor and add text
sed -i 's/oldword/newword/g' file1.txt  // Replace "oldword" with "newword"

USED COMMAND:
cd, ls, mkdir, touch, cat – File and directory navigation
cp, chmod, chown – File copying, permissions, and ownership
find, grep – Searching files and content
date, ip a, ping – System and networking info
